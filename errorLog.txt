Error log for Proshop Mern Udemy Course

10.19.2020.

The npm start error has been resolved.
The solution was that I needed to remove the node_modules directory higher up.

10.25.2020
The problem is that when I enter git add . and git commit, I get a console message saying:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

However, I have recently changed files. 

Same problem occurred again

Try to fix this by deleting the git, and then reinitializing it.
